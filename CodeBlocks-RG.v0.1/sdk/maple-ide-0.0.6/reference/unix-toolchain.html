<h1>libmaple Unix Toolchain Quickstart</h1>

You'll need a Maple board, a mini-b USB cable, a functional computer, and
possibly root access to that computer.  This guide assumes you've had success
with the IDE on your machine and that you are fairly comfortable with the unix
command line. For generic installation/setup issues the <a
href="./install.html">install </a> and <a
href="./troubleshooting.html">troubleshooting</a> pages may be helpful.  If all
else fails try <a href="http://google.com/?q=maple+help">google</a>, our <a
href="http://forum.leaflabs.com">forum</a>, or <a
href="http://leaflabs.com/contact">contact us directly</a>!

<p> 
These instructions are oriented towards Linux users using a contemporary
debian-based distribution. It should be possible to get these development tools
up and running on windows (using the <a
href="http://www.cygwin.com/">cygwin</a> Unix environment) or Mac OSX (using
Xcode developer tools and/or macports), but we've already got our hands full
supporting just the IDE on those platforms. If you're on another unix platform
we're guessing that you can translate/port these directions on your own. As a
jumping off point, you can find a stripped down distributions of the
CodeSourcery GCC compiler tools for win32 and OSX 10.6 in the same download
directory as the linux ones mentioned below.  If you <i>do</i> have success on
other platforms please post in the forums and we can fold your tips into this
document!

<h3>1. Collect and Install Tools</h3>

First i'll give the commands to run, then explain:

<pre class="code">
sudo aptitude install build-essential git-core wget screen dfu-util \
openocd python python-serial 
</pre>

You'll want to install a bunch of developer "basics" like <code>make</code>,
<code>tar</code>, etc. A good catch-all for these tools is the
"build-essential" meta-package on most debian platforms: installing this fake
package will pull in dozens of useful tools without bogging your system down
too much. <code>git-core</code> is the name of the git package; git is a
distributed code versioning system we use to track changes in our source code.
<code>wget</code> is a simple tool to download files over http from the command
line and is optional (you could pull in the required downloads using a
browser). <code>screen</code> is a really cool virtual terminal program; in the
context of Maple we use it to connect to serial port devices.

<p> <code>dfu-util</code> is a tool from the <a
href="http://openmoko.com">OpenMoko</a> project that we use to upload programs
to the Maple over USB.

<p> <code>openocd</code> is a JTAG control program used in conjunction with an
ARM JTAG device to do in circuit debugging (pause/resume program execution,
upload and download code, read out register status, etc). (optional)

<p> 
Lastly, our reset script (which sends control signals over the USB-serial
connection to restart and enter the bootloader) is written in python and
requires the PySerial library (the <code>python-serial</code> package; this
could also be installed with easy_install).

<h3>2. Fetch libmaple and Compiler Toolchain</h3>

<pre class="code">
cd ~ 
git clone git://github.com/leaflabs/libmaple.git libmaple 
cd libmaple 
wget http://static.leaflabs.com/pub/codesourcery/\
arm-2009q3-68-arm-none-eabi-toolchain-linux32.tar.gz tar xvf arm-*.tar.gz
export PATH=$PATH:~/libmaple/arm/bin # or wherever these tools ended up 
</pre>

<p> 
Fairly straight forward... do a git clone of the libmaple repository to some
directory, then download and extract the ARM compiler toolchain. 

<p> 
The <code>arm/bin/</code> directory will needs to be added to PATH; you can
check that this worked by entering <code>arm-none-</code> and hitting tab to
auto-complete (bash should show a bunch of results). If you want to move that
toolchain somewhere else and add it in a .bashrc script or whatever make sure
to preserve the directory layout as the binaries will make relative path calls
and references.

<h3>3. Install udev Rules</h3> 

<pre class="code">
groups # make sure it includes plugdev; if not add yourself to it 
sudo cp support/scripts/45-maple.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/45-maple.rules 
sudo /etc/init.d/udev restart 
</pre>

<p> 
As a security precaution on linux, unknown USB devices can only be accessed by
the superuser. This udev script identifies the Maple based on it's vendor and
product IDs, mounts it to /dev/maple, and grants read/write permissions to the
<code>plugdev</code> group. After restarting udev you'll need to fully unplug
or power cycle any Maples connected to the computer.

<h3>4. Test compilation</h3> 
<pre class="code">
cp main.cpp.example main.cpp
make clean 
make
</pre>

Ok, here's where things start to get interesting, because our repository setup
is a little unconventional. Usually libraries get compiled down to a binary
archive which other programs link (or pull from) using hints from source code
header files. With that structure the "library" code and build process is
separated from the individual "program". At this point we frequently end up
customizing the "library" part of the code to suit the "program", so we left it
all mixed together. 

<p> 
The <code>main.cpp</code> file in the top directory is often the only "program"
part of the code (of course it could reference arbitrary other source and
header files if it helped break up a larger project). At a minimum it must
declare an <code>int main(void)</code> function; our
<code>main.cpp.example</code> files takes on a structure identical to Arduino
"sketches" with <code>setup()</code> and <code>loop()</code> functions.

<p> 
A second layer of confusion is the separation between the
<code>libmaple/</code> directory and the <code>wirish/</code> directory.  The
<code>libmaple/</code> directory contains our low-level, C-only library for
accessing STM32 hardware peripherals. The <code>wirish/</code> directory
contains C++ code implementing the "Arduino programming language" (called
Wiring); our implementation is not 100% compatible, it's just "Wiring-ish".
When we casually refer to "libmaple" we usually mean both parts together. As
you may imagine, mixing C and C++ code together so close to the metal can get
pretty sticky; if you look through our code there are lots of
<code>#ifdefs</code> and other nonsense to ensure the compiler doesn't throw up
on it.

<p> 
A last, important chunk of libmaple which isn't immediately obvious are the
linker scripts in <code>support/ld/</code> which are essential for actually
building binary files. Hopefully you won't have to modify those unless you're
porting the entire library, through it can be educational to read through the
interrupt jump table. 

<p> 
The <code>Makefile</code> can build and upload to RAM or FLASH; the RAM target
is useful for rapid development because it uploads a little faster and doesn't
burn up FLASH write cycles, but programs in RAM won't persist after a power
cycle and there is significantly less memory available for more elaborate
programs. The target is determined by an environment variable,
<code>MAPLE_TARGET</code>) which defaults to FLASH. It can be modified by
editing the Makefile, specifying in the comman (eg, <code>make
MAPLE_TARGET=ram</code>), or with the <code>ram</code> and <code>flash</code>
targets, which modify the environment variable locally.  The <code>make
sketch</code> (or just <code>make</code>) target just builds .bin files;
<code>make install</code> will build and upload the program. If you forget you
can just <code>make help</code>, which dumps a table of targets.  You might
also find the <code>make cscope</code> or <code>make ctags</code> targets
helpful as well if you use those tools.

<p> 
If all goes well you should see an object size table dump something like:

<pre class="code">
find build -iname *.o | xargs arm-none-eabi-size -t
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
    482       4      24     510     1fe build/wirish/comm/HardwareSerial.o
    260       0       0     260     104 build/wirish/comm/HardwareSPI.o
     60       0       0      60      3c build/wirish/wirish.o

[...]

   2196       0       1    2197     895 build/libmaple/usb/usb_lib/usb_core.o
   1904       0       0    1904     770 build/libmaple/usb/usb_lib/usb_regs.o
     56       0       0      56      38 build/libmaple/usb/usb_lib/usb_init.o
    344       0       0     344     158 build/libmaple/usb/usb_hardware.o
   6637       0      58    6695    1a27 build/main.o
  21499     201     391   22091    564b (TOTALS)

Final Size:
arm-none-eabi-size build/maple.out
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
  21824     200     552   22576    5830 build/maple.out
Flash build
</pre>

The "dec" field at the end gives the total program size in bytes. This program
(the interactive test program, not main.cpp.example) is huge, about 22kb, and
doesn't fit in to RAM, so I used the FLASH target. Of course the program could
be easily optimized... but not today! The long listing of object files above
the Final Size helps to identify bloated code; here you can see that our USB
hardware management code and the main program itself are culprits. 

<h3>5. Upload a Program</h3>

<pre class="code">
cp examples/test-session.cpp main.cpp 
make clean 
make
make install
</pre>

Ok, let's blow away the little example program and upload the interactive test
session. Before executing <code>make install</code> you'll want to have the
udev rules setup as described above and have the Maple plugged in.

<p> 
A number of things can go wrong at this stage; simple debugging steps include
using the perpetual bootloader mode, restarting Maple a couple times, make-ing
clean, etc.

<h3>6. Communicate over USB-serial interface</h3>

<pre class="code">
screen /dev/maple # control-A, k, y to quit 
</pre>

If the interactive test program built and uploaded correctly, you should be
able to connect with <code>screen</code>. Type 'h' or hit the space bar to get
a response; there are a number of commands which demonstrate Maple peripheral
features. 

<p> 
As of June 2010 the HardwareSerial library is blocking, so using any commands
which would write to the USART Serial ports will cause the program to hang.

<h3>7. Debug with openocd</h3>

TODO. For now see <a href="http://fun-tech.se/stm32/OpenOCD/index.php">this
great guide</a> from fun-tech.se. 

<h3>8. Do it all with Code::Blocks</h3>

Code::Blocks is a generic cross platform IDE. We don't personally use it for
development so we haven't worked out all the kinks (eg, debugging isn't
intergrated), but it might be helpful for people who are allergic to vim and/or
emacs. 

The simple configuration described here just calls down to the Makefile, so
follow the above directions to get the command line tools configured (you'll
definately need the arm-none-eabi-* tools on your path by default), then
install Code::Blocks:

<pre class="code">
sudo aptitude install codeblocks 
</pre>

The first time it runs you'll maybe want to disable all the glitzy "Getting
started" crap (when will they learn?). We've added a .cbp "projects" file to
the libmaple repository: you can try using that one by copying it from
<code>support/codeblocks/libmaple.cbp</code> to the top level directory, but no
promises (it might be missing new source files etc). It's probably worth
reading through these instructions as well to get a feel for how it all works. 

<p> 
To create your own "libmaple" project, start with an "Empty Project" with the
"Folder to create project in" set to your libmaple directory. Make sure that
the "Resulting filename" is in the top level directory as well.  

<br><br>
<div class="centerimg"> 
<img src="./img/codeblocks_newproject.png" > 
</div>

<p>
Select the "GNU GCC Compiler" (it won't be used anyways) and disable the
"Debug" configuration in the next window. Now you should have a project with no
files; add files by right clicking on the project in the left panel file
heirarchy and "Add files recursively". Import both the wirish and libmaple
directories recursively, then add main.cpp seperately. 

<br><br>
<div class="centerimg"> 
<img src="./img/codeblocks_makefile.png" > 
</div>

<p> 
Next we have to configure the Makefile targets. Go to the "Properties..." menu
under "Project" and check the "This is a custom Makefile" box. Then go to the
"Build tagets" tab and create "ram" and "flash" targets, both of type "Console
application" and without the Auto-generated filename prefixes or extensions.
Set the Output filename to <code>support/codeblocks/program_flash.sh</code> and
<code>support/codeblocks/program_ram.sh</code> respectively; these scripts just
call the program_ram/program_flash make targets and are a hack to get the "run"
button to upload code to the Maple. The IDE will warn that these files
will be overwritten, but they won't be. For both the "flash" and "ram" targets,
click the "Build options..." button button (below "Virtual targets..." etc) and
go to the far right tab ("'Make' commands"). Edit the Clean project/target line
so it's just "clean" (not "clean$target"), and set the "Build project/target"
and "Compile single file" commands to <code>$make -f $makefile MAPLE_TARGET=$target</code>
and <code>$make -f $makefile MAPLE_TARGET=$target $file</code> respectively.

<br><br>
<div class="centerimg"> 
<img src="./img/codeblocks_maketargets.png" > 
</div>

<p>
Save all these changes, go back to the main IDE window, and try to build/run.
"Build" will compile everything, "Run" will run the upload script in a terminal
window (if there are problems they will flash by very quickly; you can start
Code::Blocks in a terminal window and check the output in that base window if
necessary), and "Rebuild" will clean before rebuilding. 

<br><br>
<div class="centerimg"> 
<img src="./img/codeblocks_build.png" > 
<br>Success!
</div>
