A portable version of the free, open-source Code::Blocks C/C++ Integrated development Environment (IDE) configured as an easy-to-install package for the Windows operating system.

Why EDU (education)?
CodeBlocks EP comes pre-installed for teaching institutions and learners of C or C++ with:
- easy access to C/C++ language help (by pressing F1 and via the Help menu)
- promotion of strict C or C++ programming language standards.
- static code checking (cppcheck)

Why Portable?
- Being portable allows using portable Code::Blocks without interference on PCs where other related software (MinGW, non-portable CB, various programmer-help tools) is already installed.
- Being portable allows it to be carried around on a USB stick or external HDD.
